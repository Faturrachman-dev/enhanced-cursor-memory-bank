# COMMAND EXECUTION SYSTEM

> **TL;DR:** This system provides guidelines for efficient and reliable command and tool usage. Prioritize `edit_file` for file content, `fetch_rules` for loading `.mdc` rules, and `run_terminal_cmd` for execution tasks. Always document actions and results in `memory-bank/activeContext.md`.

## üõ†Ô∏è TOOL PRIORITY & USAGE

1.  **`edit_file` (Primary for Content):**
    *   Use for ALL creation and modification of `.md` files in `memory-bank/` and `documentation/`.
    *   Use for ALL source code modifications.
    *   `edit_file` can create a new file if it doesn't exist and populate it.
    *   Provide clear instructions or full content blocks for `edit_file`.
2.  **`fetch_rules` (Primary for `.mdc` Rules):**
    *   Use to load and follow instructions from other `.mdc` rule files within `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/`.
    *   Specify the full path to the target `.mdc` file.
3.  **`read_file` (Primary for Context Gathering):**
    *   Use to read existing project files (source code, `README.md`), `memory-bank/*.md` files for context, or `.mdc` files if `fetch_rules` is not appropriate for the specific need (e.g., just extracting a template).
4.  **`run_terminal_cmd` (Primary for Execution):**
    *   Use for tasks like `mkdir`, running tests, build scripts, or starting servers.
    *   **CRITICAL:** Be platform-aware (see "Platform-Specific Considerations" below). If unsure of the OS, state your default command (e.g., for Linux) and ask for the Windows PowerShell equivalent if needed.
5.  **`list_dir`, `search_files`, `codebase_search`:**
    *   Use for file system exploration and code/text searching as appropriate.

```
**Textual Guide for AI:**
1.  **Analyze Requirements:** Understand what needs to be achieved.
2.  **Select Correct Tool:** Choose `edit_file` for content, `fetch_rules` for rules, `run_terminal_cmd` for execution, etc.
3.  **Execute:** Perform the action. For complex sequences, break it down into clear, tool-specific steps.
4.  **Verify Results:** If you used `edit_file`, consider using `read_file` to confirm the content. If `run_terminal_cmd`, examine the output.
5.  **Document Action & Result:** Use `edit_file` to append a summary of the command/tool call and its outcome to the "Build Log" or relevant section in `memory-bank/activeContext.md`.

## üö¶ DIRECTORY VERIFICATION (for `run_terminal_cmd`)
**Textual Guide for AI:**
1.  Before running build scripts or package manager commands (npm, pip) via `run_terminal_cmd`, verify you are in the correct project root directory.
2.  Use `list_dir` to check for key files like `package.json` or `requirements.txt`.
3.  If not in the correct directory, use `run_terminal_cmd` with `cd [path_to_project_root]` to navigate.

## üìã COMMAND DOCUMENTATION TEMPLATE (for `activeContext.md` "Build Log")
When documenting your actions, use `edit_file` to append entries like this to `memory-bank/activeContext.md`:
```markdown
### Action: [Purpose of the action]
- **Tool Used:** `[edit_file | fetch_rules | run_terminal_cmd | etc.]`
- **Target/Command:** `[file_path | rule_path | actual_terminal_command]`
- **Parameters (if applicable):** `[e.g., content for edit_file, search query]`
- **Expected Outcome:** `[Briefly what you expected]`
- **Actual Result:**
  \`\`\`
  [Output from run_terminal_cmd, or confirmation of file edit/read]
  \`\`\`
- **Effect:** `[Brief description of what changed in the system or Memory Bank]`
- **Next Steps:** `[What you plan to do next]`
```

## üîç PLATFORM-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS (for `run_terminal_cmd`)
**Textual Guide for AI:**
*   **Windows (PowerShell):** Path separator: `\`, Dir creation: `mkdir my_dir` or `New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path my_dir`.
*   **Unix/Linux/Mac (Bash/Zsh):** Path separator: `/`, Dir creation: `mkdir -p my_dir`.
*   **Action:** If unsure of OS, state default (Linux) and ask for Windows PowerShell equivalent or user OS specification.

## üìù COMMAND EXECUTION CHECKLIST (AI Self-Correction)
- Purpose clear? Correct tool chosen? Platform considerations for `run_terminal_cmd`? Action/result documented in `activeContext.md` via `edit_file`? Outcome verified?

## üö® WARNINGS
*   Avoid `run_terminal_cmd` with `echo > file` or `Add-Content` for multi-line content. **Always use `edit_file`**.
*   For destructive `run_terminal_cmd` (e.g., `rm`), seek user confirmation.

## üß† HOW YOU EXECUTE HIERARCHICAL LOADING:
1.  **Mode Activation:** Your main custom prompt for a mode (e.g., VAN) tells you to `fetch_rules` for its primary orchestrating `.mdc` (e.g., `visual-maps/van_mode_split/van-mode-map.mdc`).
2.  **Following Instructions:** That `.mdc` guides you. Some steps might instruct: "If [condition], then `fetch_rules` to load and follow `[specific_sub_rule.mdc]`." For example, `van-mode-map.mdc` might tell you to `fetch_rules` for `Core/complexity-decision-tree.mdc`.
3.  **Current Rule Focus:** Always operate based on the instructions from the most recently fetched and relevant rule. Once a fetched rule's instructions are complete, you "return" to the context of the rule that fetched it, or if it was a top-level fetch, you await further user instruction or mode transition.
4.  **Acknowledge Fetches:** When you `fetch_rules` for an `.mdc`, briefly state: "Fetched `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/[rule_path]`. Now proceeding with its instructions."

## üîÑ CONTEXT TRANSFER PROCESS (AI Actions):

1.  **Before Current Mode Exits (or suggests exiting):**
    a.  Your current instructions (from main prompt or an `.mdc` via `fetch_rules`) will guide you to use `edit_file` to update `memory-bank/activeContext.md`.
    b.  This update should include a section like:
        ```markdown
        ## Mode Transition Prepared - [Timestamp]
        - **From Mode:** [Current Mode, e.g., PLAN]
        - **To Mode Recommended:** [Target Mode, e.g., CREATIVE or IMPLEMENT]
        - **Current Task Focus:** [Specific task name or ID from tasks.md]
        - **Key Outputs/Decisions from [Current Mode]:**
            - [Summary of what was achieved, e.g., "Plan for user authentication feature is complete."]
            - [Reference to key artifacts created/updated, e.g., "See `memory-bank/tasks.md` for detailed sub-tasks. Creative design needed for UI components."]
        - **Primary Goal for [Target Mode]:** [What the next mode should focus on, e.g., "Design UI mockups for login and registration pages."]
        ```
2.  **When New Mode Starts:**
    a.  The new mode's main custom prompt (in Cursor's Advanced Settings) will instruct you to `fetch_rules` for its primary orchestrating `.mdc` file (e.g., `visual-maps/creative-mode-map.mdc`).
    b.  That orchestrating `.mdc` will (as an early step) instruct you to `read_file memory-bank/activeContext.md` to understand the incoming context, task focus, and goals.

**Key Principle:** `memory-bank/activeContext.md` is the primary "handover document" between modes, managed by `edit_file`. Keep its "Mode Transition Prepared" section concise and actionable for the next mode.

# MEMORY BANK OPTIMIZATION INTEGRATION (AI Understanding)

> **TL;DR:** You enact Memory Bank optimizations by following specific instructions from other rule files that guide hierarchical rule loading, adaptive complexity, and progressive documentation. This is not a standalone process you run, but a result of adhering to the CMB framework.

## üîÑ HOW YOU ACHIEVE OPTIMIZATIONS:
You don't "run" an optimization integration flow. You achieve system optimizations by:
1.  **Hierarchical Rule Loading:** Following `fetch_rules` instructions in main prompts and other `.mdc` files to load only necessary rules when they are needed. This keeps your immediate context focused and relevant. (See `Core/hierarchical-rule-loading.mdc`).
2.  **Adaptive Complexity Model:** Following `Core/complexity-decision-tree.mdc` (when fetched in VAN mode) to assess task complexity. Then, loading level-specific rules (from `LevelX/` directories) as directed by subsequent instructions. This tailors the process to the task's needs.
3.  **Dynamic Context Management:** Diligently using `read_file` to get context from, and `edit_file` to update, key Memory Bank files like `memory-bank/activeContext.md`, `memory-bank/tasks.md`, and `memory-bank/progress.md`. This ensures context is current and progressively built.
4.  **Transition Optimization:** Following the process in `Core/mode-transition-optimization.mdc` (i.e., updating `activeContext.md` before a mode switch to ensure smooth handover).
5.  **Creative Phase Optimization:** Using templates and structured guidance like `Phases/CreativePhase/optimized-creative-template.mdc` (when fetched in CREATIVE mode) to ensure thorough but efficient design exploration.
6.  **Tool Prioritization:** Consistently using the right tool for the job (e.g., `edit_file` for content, `run_terminal_cmd` for execution) as outlined in `Core/command-execution.mdc`. This avoids inefficient or error-prone methods.

**This document explains the *design goals* of the CMB system. Your role is to execute the specific, actionable instructions in other `.mdc` files. By following those rules, you are inherently participating in and enabling these optimizations.**

> **TL;DR:** When using `run_terminal_cmd`, be aware of OS differences (paths, common commands). If unsure, state your default command (Linux-style) and ask the user to confirm or provide the platform-specific version (e.g., for Windows PowerShell).

## üîç AI ACTION FOR PLATFORM AWARENESS:

1.  **Identify Need for `run_terminal_cmd`:** This tool is for tasks like `mkdir`, running scripts (e.g., `npm run build`, `python manage.py test`), installing packages (`pip install`, `npm install`), or other shell operations. **Do NOT use it for creating or editing file content; use `edit_file` for that.**
2.  **Consider Platform Differences:**
    *   **Path Separators:** `/` (common for Linux, macOS, and often works in modern Windows PowerShell) vs. `\` (traditional Windows). When constructing paths for commands, be mindful.
    *   **Common Commands:**
        *   Directory Creation: `mkdir -p path/to/dir` (Linux/macOS) vs. `New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path path\to\dir` or `mkdir path\to\dir` (Windows PowerShell).
        *   Listing Directory Contents: `ls -la` (Linux/macOS) vs. `Get-ChildItem` or `dir` (Windows PowerShell).
        *   File Deletion: `rm path/to/file` (Linux/macOS) vs. `Remove-Item path\to\file` (Windows PowerShell).
        *   Environment Variables: `export VAR=value` (Linux/macOS) vs. `$env:VAR="value"` (Windows PowerShell).
3.  **Execution Strategy with `run_terminal_cmd`:**
    a.  **Check Context:** `read_file memory-bank/techContext.md` or `memory-bank/activeContext.md` to see if the OS has been previously identified.
    b.  **If OS is Known:** Use the appropriate command syntax for that OS.
    c.  **If OS is Unknown or Unsure:**
        i.  State your intended action and the command you would typically use (default to Linux-style if no other info). Example: "To create the directory `my_app/src`, I would use `run_terminal_cmd` with `mkdir -p my_app/src`."
        ii. Ask for Confirmation/Correction: "Is this command correct for your operating system? If you are on Windows, please provide the PowerShell equivalent."
        iii. Await user confirmation or correction before proceeding with `run_terminal_cmd`.
    d.  **Clearly State Command:** Before execution, always state the exact command you are about to run with `run_terminal_cmd`.
4.  **Document Action and Outcome:**
    a.  After `run_terminal_cmd` completes, use `edit_file` to log the command, its full output (or a summary if very long), and success/failure status in `memory-bank/activeContext.md` under a "Terminal Command Log" or similar section. (Refer to `Core/command-execution.mdc` for the log template).

**This is a guiding principle. The key is to be *aware* of potential differences, default to a common standard (like Linux commands), and proactively seek clarification from the user when unsure to ensure `run_terminal_cmd` is used safely and effectively.**

# REFLECT MODE: TASK REVIEW PROCESS MAP (AI Instructions)

> **TL;DR:** Review the completed implementation, document insights and lessons learned in `memory-bank/reflection/reflect-[task_name]-[date].md`. Use `edit_file` for all documentation. Fetch level-specific reflection rules for detailed guidance.

## üß≠ REFLECT MODE PROCESS FLOW (AI Actions)

1.  **Acknowledge & Context Gathering:**
    a.  State: "Initiating REFLECT mode for the current task."
    b.  `read_file memory-bank/activeContext.md` to identify the current task, its complexity level, and confirmation that IMPLEMENT phase is complete.
    c.  `read_file memory-bank/tasks.md` for the original plan, sub-tasks, and requirements.
    d.  `read_file memory-bank/progress.md` to review the implementation journey and any challenges logged.
    e.  `read_file` any relevant `memory-bank/creative/creative-[component]-[date].md` documents (for L3/L4) to compare design with implementation.
2.  **Pre-Reflection Check (AI Self-Correction):**
    a.  Verify from `tasks.md` or `activeContext.md` that the IMPLEMENT phase for the current task is marked as complete.
    b.  If not, state: "REFLECT BLOCKED: Implementation phase is not yet complete for task [task_name]. Please complete IMPLEMENT mode first." Await user.
3.  **Fetch Level-Specific Reflection Rule:**
    a.  Based on the complexity level:
        *   **Level 1:** `fetch_rules` for `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/Level1/reflection-basic.mdc`. (If not present, use L2)
        *   **Level 2:** `fetch_rules` for `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/Level2/reflection-basic.mdc`. (Note: `rules-visual-maps.txt` refers to `reflection-standard.md` for L2, I'll use `reflection-basic` as per `STRUCTURE.md` or assume they are similar. If a specific `reflection-standard.mdc` exists, use that).
        *   **Level 3:** `fetch_rules` for `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/Level3/reflection-intermediate.mdc`.
        *   **Level 4:** `fetch_rules` for `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/Level4/reflection-comprehensive.mdc`.
4.  **Follow Fetched Rule (Structured Reflection):**
    a.  The fetched level-specific `.mdc` rule will guide you through the reflection process, which involves creating/updating `memory-bank/reflection/reflect-[task_name_or_id]-[date].md` using `edit_file`. Key sections to populate (guided by the fetched rule):
        i.  **Summary of Task & Outcome:** What was built, did it meet goals?
        ii. **What Went Well:** Successful aspects, efficient processes.
        iii. **Challenges Encountered:** Difficulties, roadblocks, unexpected issues. How were they overcome?
        iv. **Lessons Learned:** Key takeaways, new knowledge gained (technical, process-wise).
        v.  **Comparison with Plan/Design:** Deviations from original plan/design and why.
        vi. **Process Improvements:** Suggestions for future tasks.
        vii. **Technical Improvements/Alternatives:** Better technical approaches for similar future tasks.
        viii. **Code Quality/Maintainability Assessment (if applicable).**
    b.  Use `edit_file` to meticulously populate the reflection document.
    c.  Update `memory-bank/activeContext.md` with notes like "Reflection in progress for [task_name]."
5.  **Notify Completion:**
    a.  Once the reflection document is complete as per the fetched rule, state: "REFLECTION COMPLETE for task [task_name]. Reflection document created/updated at `memory-bank/reflection/reflect-[task_name_or_id]-[date].md`."
    b.  Use `edit_file` to update `memory-bank/tasks.md`, marking the REFLECT phase as complete for the task.
    c.  Use `edit_file` to update `memory-bank/activeContext.md`: "Reflection phase complete for [task_name]. Ready for ARCHIVE mode."
    d.  Recommend: "Recommend transitioning to ARCHIVE mode to finalize and store task documentation." Await user.

2.  **Define Checks (Based on Context):**
    *   **Example for Node.js project:**
        *   Check Node.js installed and version (e.g., `node -v`).
        *   Check npm installed and version (e.g., `npm -v`).
        *   Check `package.json` exists (e.g., `list_dir .`).
        *   If `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` exists, consider running `npm ci` or `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` (or just `npm install`/`yarn install` if less strict) to verify/install packages.
    *   **Example for Python project:**
        *   Check Python installed and version (e.g., `python --version` or `python3 --version`).
        *   Check pip installed (usually comes with Python).
        *   Check `requirements.txt` exists.
        *   Consider creating a virtual environment and `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3.  **Execute Checks (Using `run_terminal_cmd`):**
    a.  For each defined check:
        i.  Clearly state the command you are about to run.
        ii. `run_terminal_cmd` with the command.
        iii. Record the output.
4.  **Evaluate Results & Log:**
    a.  Based on command outputs, determine if dependencies are met.

## ‚öôÔ∏è AI ACTIONS FOR CONFIGURATION VALIDATION:

1.  **Acknowledge & Context:**
    a.  State: "Starting Configuration Validation."
    b.  `read_file memory-bank/techContext.md` and `memory-bank/tasks.md` to identify relevant configuration files based on the project type and technology stack.

    *   **Example for a TypeScript/React project:**
        *   `package.json`: `read_file package.json`. Check for valid JSON structure (conceptually, AI doesn't parse JSON strictly but looks for malformations). Check for essential scripts (`build`, `start`, `test`).
        *   `tsconfig.json`: `read_file tsconfig.json`. Check for valid JSON. Check for key compiler options like `jsx`, `target`, `moduleResolution`.
        *   `.eslintrc.js` or `eslint.config.js`: `read_file [config_name]`. Check for basic structural integrity.
        *   `vite.config.js` or `webpack.config.js`: `read_file [config_name]`. Check for presence of key plugins (e.g., React plugin).
3.  **Execute Checks (Primarily using `read_file` and analysis):**
    a.  For each configuration file:
        i.  `read_file [config_filepath]`.
        ii. Analyze its content against expected structure or key settings.
        iii. For linting/formatting configs, note their presence. Actual linting runs are usually part of build/test steps.
4.  **Evaluate Results & Log:**
    a.  Based on file content analysis, determine if configurations seem correct and complete.
    b.  Use `edit_file` to append detailed findings to the "VAN QA Log" in `memory-bank/activeContext.md`:

# VAN QA: ENVIRONMENT VALIDATION (AI Instructions)

> **TL;DR:** Validate the development/build environment (e.g., required CLI tools available, necessary permissions, environment variables). Log findings to `activeContext.md` using `edit_file`. This rule is fetched by `van-qa-main.mdc`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è AI ACTIONS FOR ENVIRONMENT VALIDATION:

1.  **Acknowledge & Context:**
    a.  State: "Starting Environment Validation."
    b.  `read_file memory-bank/techContext.md` to identify expected environment characteristics (e.g., OS, required CLIs like Git, Docker).
2.  **Define Checks (Based on Context):**
    *   **General Checks:**
        *   Git CLI: `run_terminal_cmd git --version`.
        *   Network connectivity (if external resources needed for build): (Conceptual check, or a simple `ping google.com` if allowed and relevant).
    *   **Example for Web Development:**
        *   Build tool (e.g., Vite, Webpack if used globally): `run_terminal_cmd vite --version` (if applicable).
        *   Port availability (e.g., for dev server): (Conceptual, AI can't directly check. Note if a common port like 3000 or 8080 is usually needed).
    *   **Permissions:**
        *   (Conceptual) Does the AI anticipate needing to write files outside `memory-bank/` or project dir during build? If so, note potential permission needs. Actual permission checks are hard for AI.
3.  **Execute Checks (Using `run_terminal_cmd` where appropriate):**
    a.  For each defined check:
        i.  State the command or check being performed.
        ii. If using `run_terminal_cmd`, record the output.
4.  **Evaluate Results & Log:**
    a.  Based on command outputs and conceptual checks, determine if the environment seems suitable.
    b.  Use `edit_file` to append detailed findings to the "VAN QA Log" in `memory-bank/activeContext.md`:
        ```markdown
        #### Environment Check Log - [Timestamp]
        - Check: Git CLI availability
          - Command: `git --version`
          - Output: `git version 2.30.0`
          - Status: PASS
        - Check: Port 3000 availability for dev server
          - Method: Conceptual (not directly testable by AI)
          - Assumption: Port 3000 should be free.
          - Status: NOTE (User should ensure port is free)

## ‚öôÔ∏è AI ACTIONS FOR MINIMAL BUILD TEST:

1.  **Acknowledge & Context:**
    a.  State: "Starting Minimal Build Test."
    b.  `read_file package.json` (or equivalent like `Makefile`, `pom.xml`) to identify build commands.
    c.  `read_file memory-bank/techContext.md` for info on build tools.
2.  **Define Build Command:**
    a.  Identify the primary build script (e.g., `npm run build`, `mvn package`, `make`).
    b.  Consider if a "dry run" or "lint-only" or "compile-only" version of the build command exists to test the toolchain without full artifact generation (e.g., `tsc --noEmit` for TypeScript). If so, prefer it for a *minimal* test. If not, use the standard build command.
3.  **Execute Build Command (Using `run_terminal_cmd`):**
    a.  State the exact build command you are about to run.
    b.  Ensure you are in the correct directory (usually project root). `list_dir .` to confirm presence of `package.json` etc. If not, use `cd` via `run_terminal_cmd`.
    c.  `run_terminal_cmd [build_command]`.
    d.  Capture the full output.
4.  **Evaluate Results & Log:**
    a.  Analyze the output for success messages or error codes/messages.

## ‚öôÔ∏è AI ACTIONS FOR DETAILED FILE VERIFICATION:

1.  **Acknowledge & Context:**
    a.  State: "Starting Detailed File Verification."
    b.  `read_file memory-bank/tasks.md` or `activeContext.md` to understand which specific files or artifact locations need verification as part of the current QA scope (e.g., "ensure `dist/bundle.js` is created after build", "check `config.yaml` has specific keys").
    c.  If no specific files are targeted for this QA check, state so and this check can be considered trivially PASS.
2.  **Define Checks (Based on QA Scope):**
    *   **Existence Check:** `list_dir [path_to_dir]` to see if `[filename]` is present.
    *   **Content Snippet Check:** `read_file [filepath]` and then search for a specific string or pattern within the content.
    *   **File Size Check (Conceptual):** If a build artifact is expected, `list_dir -l [filepath]` (Unix-like) or `Get-ChildItem [filepath] | Select-Object Length` (PowerShell) might give size. AI notes if it's unexpectedly zero or very small.
    *   **Structure Check (Conceptual for complex files like XML/JSON):** `read_file [filepath]` and describe if it generally conforms to expected structure (e.g., "appears to be valid JSON with a root object containing 'data' and 'errors' keys").
3.  **Execute Checks (Using `list_dir`, `read_file`, or `run_terminal_cmd` for file system info):**
    a.  For each defined file check:
        i.  State the file and the check being performed.
        ii. Execute the appropriate tool/command.
        iii. Record the observation/output.
4.  **Evaluate Results & Log:**
    a.  Based on observations, determine if file verifications pass.

# VAN QA: COMMON VALIDATION FIXES (AI Guidance)

> **TL;DR:** Provides common troubleshooting steps and fix suggestions when VAN QA checks fail. This rule is fetched by `van-qa-main.mdc` after a QA failure is reported.

## ‚öôÔ∏è AI ACTIONS (Present this information to the user):

State: "Here are some common troubleshooting steps based on the type of QA failure. Please review the detailed failure report and attempt these fixes:"

### 1. Dependency Issues:
*   **Missing Tools (Node, Python, Git, etc.):**
    *   "Ensure the required tool ([Tool Name]) is installed and available in your system's PATH. You might need to download it from its official website or install it via your system's package manager."
*   **Incorrect Tool Version:**
    *   "The version of [Tool Name] found is [Found Version], but [Required Version] is expected. Consider using a version manager (like nvm for Node, pyenv for Python) to switch to the correct version, or update/downgrade the tool."
*   **Project Dependencies (`npm install` / `pip install` failed):**
    *   "Check the error messages from the package manager (`npm`, `pip`). Common causes include network issues, permission problems, or incompatible sub-dependencies."
    *   "Try deleting `node_modules/` and `package-lock.json` (or `venv/` and `requirements.txt` conflicts) and running the install command again."
    *   "Ensure your `package.json` or `requirements.txt` is correctly formatted and specifies valid package versions."

### 2. Configuration Issues:
*   **File Not Found:**
    *   "The configuration file `[filepath]` was not found. Ensure it exists at the correct location in your project."
*   **Syntax Errors (JSON, JS, etc.):**
    *   "The file `[filepath]` appears to have syntax errors. Please open it and check for typos, missing commas, incorrect brackets, etc. Using a code editor with linting can help."
*   **Missing Key Settings:**
    *   "The configuration file `[filepath]` is missing an expected setting: `[setting_name]`. Please add it according to the project's requirements (e.g., add `jsx: 'react-jsx'` to `tsconfig.json`)."

### 3. Environment Issues:
*   **Command Not Found (for build tools like `vite`, `tsc`):**
    *   "The command `[command_name]` was not found. If it's a project-local tool, ensure you've run `npm install` (or equivalent) and try prefixing with `npx` (e.g., `npx vite build`). If it's a global tool, ensure it's installed globally."
*   **Permission Denied:**
    *   "An operation failed due to insufficient permissions. You might need to run your terminal/IDE as an administrator (Windows) or use `sudo` (macOS/Linux) for specific commands, but be cautious with `sudo`."
    *   "Check file/folder permissions if trying to write to a restricted area."
*   **Port in Use:**
    *   "The build or dev server tried to use port `[port_number]`, which is already in use. Identify and stop the process using that port, or configure your project to use a different port."

### 4. Minimal Build Test Issues:
*   **Build Script Fails:**
    *   "The command `[build_command]` failed. Examine the full error output from the build process. It often points to missing dependencies, configuration errors, or code syntax issues."
    *   "Ensure all dependencies from `dependency-check.mdc` are resolved first."
*   **Entry Point Errors / Module Not Found:**
    *   "The build process reported it couldn't find a key file or module. Check paths in your configuration files (e.g., `vite.config.js`, `webpack.config.js`) and in your import statements in code."

**General Advice to User:**
"After attempting fixes, please type 'VAN QA' again to re-run the technical validation process."

## ‚öôÔ∏è AI ACTIONS FOR MODE TRANSITION (POST QA SUCCESS):

1.  **Acknowledge:** State: "VAN QA validation passed successfully."
2.  **Update `activeContext.md`:**
    a.  Use `edit_file` to update `memory-bank/activeContext.md` with:

    a.  State: "All technical pre-flight checks are green. The project appears ready for implementation."
    b.  State: "Recommend transitioning to BUILD mode. Type 'BUILD' to begin implementation."
4.  **Await User Confirmation:** Await the user to type 'BUILD' or another command.

## üîí BUILD MODE ACCESS (Conceptual Reminder for AI):
*   The system is designed such that if a user tries to enter 'BUILD' mode directly without VAN QA having passed (for tasks requiring it), the BUILD mode orchestrator (or a preceding check) should ideally verify the `.qa_validation_status` file or `activeContext.md` and block if QA was needed but not passed. This current rule (`mode-transitions.mdc`) focuses on the *recommendation* after a *successful* QA.

# VAN QA: COMPREHENSIVE RULE CALLING GUIDE (AI Reference)

> **TL;DR:** This is a reference for understanding how VAN QA rules are structured to be called using `fetch_rules`. You typically won't fetch this rule directly unless you are trying to understand the system's design or if explicitly told to by a higher-level debugging instruction.

## üîç RULE CALLING BASICS for CMB System:

1.  **`fetch_rules` is Key:** All `.mdc` rule files in this system are designed to be loaded and executed via the `fetch_rules` tool.
2.  **Exact Paths:** When an instruction says "fetch rule X", it implies using `fetch_rules` with the full path from `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/`, for example: `fetch_rules` for `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/visual-maps/van_mode_split/van-qa-main.mdc`.
3.  **Orchestration:**
    *   Top-level mode maps (e.g., `van-mode-map.mdc`, `plan-mode-map.mdc`) are fetched first based on the user's mode invocation and your main custom prompt.
    *   These orchestrators then `fetch_rules` for more specific sub-rules or utility rules as needed.
4.  **VAN QA Orchestration Example:**

    *   `van-mode-map.mdc` then `fetch_rules` for `van-qa-main.mdc`.
    *   `van-qa-main.mdc` then `fetch_rules` sequentially for:
        *   `van-qa-checks/dependency-check.mdc`

        *   `van-qa-utils/reports.mdc`
        *   And then either `van-qa-utils/mode-transitions.mdc` (on PASS) or `van-qa-utils/common-fixes.mdc` (on FAIL).

## üõ†Ô∏è HOW TO STRUCTURE A `fetch_rules` CALL (Conceptual for AI):
When you decide to use `fetch_rules` based on an instruction:
1.  Identify the **exact path** of the `.mdc` file to be fetched.
2.  Invoke the `fetch_rules` tool with that path.
3.  Announce: "Fetching rule: `[path_to_rule.mdc]`. Will now follow its instructions."
4.  Temporarily suspend execution of the current rule's instructions and begin executing the instructions from the newly fetched rule.
5.  Once the fetched rule completes its defined actions, control conceptually "returns" to the rule that called it, or if it was a top-level call, you await further user input.

**This guide is for your understanding of the system's design. In practice, you will be explicitly told which rule to `fetch_rules` for by the currently active rule or your main mode prompt.**

# VAN QA: HOW TO CALL RULES (Quick Syntax Reminder)

> **TL;DR:** This provides a very basic syntax reminder for using `fetch_rules`. You generally won't need to fetch this rule; it's a developer note.

## ‚öôÔ∏è `fetch_rules` SYNTAX REMINDER:

When your instructions tell you to "fetch rule X", the underlying mechanism uses the `fetch_rules` tool.

If you were to represent the call you make (conceptually, as the tool call is handled by the Cursor environment):

You would be invoking `fetch_rules` with a parameter specifying the rule name(s) as a list of strings. For a single rule:

```xml
<invoke_tool>
  <tool_name>fetch_rules</tool_name>
  <parameters>
    <rule_names>["FULL_PATH_FROM_ISOLATION_RULES_DIR_TO_MDC_FILE"]</rule_names>
  </parameters>
</invoke_tool>
```
For example:
`rule_names=["visual-maps/van_mode_split/van-qa-main.mdc"]`
(Assuming the system resolves this relative to `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/`)

**You typically don't construct this XML. You just follow the instruction "fetch rule X" and the system handles the invocation.** The key is providing the correct, full path to the `.mdc` file as specified in the instructions.

2.  **Analyze & Locate:**
    a.  Briefly analyze the issue described in `tasks.md`.
    b.  If file paths are not provided, use `codebase_search` or `search_files` to locate the relevant code section(s).
3.  **Implement Fix:**
    a.  Use `edit_file` to make the necessary code changes directly.
    b.  Keep changes minimal and targeted, as expected for Level 1.
4.  **Verify (Conceptually or via Simple Test):**
    a.  Mentally review the change.
    b.  If a very simple test command is appropriate (e.g., linting the changed file, running a single specific test if available), use `run_terminal_cmd`.
5.  **Document (Consolidated):**
    a.  Use `edit_file` to update `memory-bank/tasks.md` with a concise record of the fix. Use a consolidated format.
        **Example Content for `tasks.md` (append under relevant task or in a 'Completed L1 Fixes' section):**

# QUICK DOCUMENTATION FOR LEVEL 1 TASKS (AI Instructions)

> **TL;DR:** This rule outlines the concise documentation approach for Level 1 tasks. The primary record is made in `memory-bank/tasks.md` using `edit_file`.

## üìã DOCUMENTATION PRINCIPLES (AI Self-Guide)
*   **Conciseness:** Brief but complete.
*   **Focus:** Only essential information to understand the fix.
*   **Findability:** Ensure the fix can be referenced via `tasks.md`.

## üìù QUICK FIX DOCUMENTATION TEMPLATE (For `tasks.md` update via `edit_file`)
When a Level 1 task is completed, use `edit_file` to update its entry or add a new entry in `memory-bank/tasks.md` under a "Completed Level 1 Fixes" or similar section, following this structure:

```markdown
- **L1 Fix:** [Issue Title/ID from original task]
  - **Issue:** [Brief description of the problem - 1-2 sentences]
  - **Root Cause:** [Concise description of what caused the issue - 1-2 sentences, if readily apparent]
  - **Solution:** [Brief description of the fix implemented - 2-3 sentences, e.g., "Modified `user_controller.js` line 75 to correctly handle null input for username."]
  - **Files Changed:**
    - `[path/to/file1.ext]`
    - `[path/to/file2.ext]` (if applicable)
  - **Verification:** [How the fix was tested/verified - 1-2 sentences, e.g., "Manually tested login with empty username field.", "Ran linter on changed file."]
  - **Status:** COMPLETED - [Date]
```

## üîÑ MEMORY BANK UPDATES (AI Actions)

1.  **`tasks.md` (Primary Record):**
    *   Use `edit_file` to add/update the entry as per the template above. This is the main documentation for L1 fixes.
2.  **`activeContext.md` (Minimal Update):**
    *   Use `edit_file` to append a brief note to `memory-bank/activeContext.md` if desired, e.g.:
        ```markdown
        ### Recent L1 Fixes - [Date]
        - Fixed [Issue Title] in `[main_file_changed]`. See `tasks.md` for details.
        ```
    *   More importantly, clear the L1 task from the "Current Focus" in `activeContext.md`.
3.  **`progress.md` (Optional Minimal Update):**
    *   Use `edit_file` to append a one-liner to `memory-bank/progress.md` if desired, e.g.:
        `[Date] - L1 Fix: Completed [Issue Title].`

**Focus:** The goal is efficient capture of essential information directly in `tasks.md` using `edit_file`.
(This rule provides the *content structure*. The actual workflow is often directed by `Level1/workflow-level1.mdc` or `Level1/optimized-workflow-level1.mdc` which might refer to these content guidelines).

# STREAMLINED WORKFLOW FOR LEVEL 1 TASKS (AI Instructions)

> **TL;DR:** This rule guides the AI through a minimal workflow for Level 1 (Quick Bug Fix) tasks. It emphasizes rapid issue resolution and concise documentation, primarily using `edit_file`.

## üß≠ LEVEL 1 WORKFLOW PHASES (AI Actions)

This workflow is typically fetched after VAN mode has confirmed the task as Level 1.

### Phase 1: INITIALIZATION (Quick Confirmation)

1.  **Acknowledge & Context:**
    a.  State: "Initiating Level 1 Workflow for [Task Name from activeContext.md]."
    b.  `read_file memory-bank/tasks.md` to confirm the specific issue details.
    c.  `read_file memory-bank/activeContext.md` for current focus.
2.  **Environment Setup (Conceptual):**
    a.  No complex setup expected for L1. Assume environment is ready.
3.  **Task Entry Check:**
    a.  Ensure a minimal task entry exists in `tasks.md` for the issue. If VAN mode created a detailed one, that's fine. If not, ensure at least a line item is there.
    b.  `edit_file memory-bank/activeContext.md` to confirm: "Focus: L1 Fix - [Task Name]".
4.  **Milestone:** State "L1 Initialization complete. Proceeding to Implementation."

### Phase 2: IMPLEMENTATION (Direct Fix)

1.  **Locate Issue Source:**
    a.  If `tasks.md` or `activeContext.md` specifies file(s) and line(s), use that.
    b.  If not, use `codebase_search` or `search_files` with keywords from the issue description to find the relevant code.
2.  **Develop & Apply Fix:**
    a.  Use `edit_file` to make the targeted code change.
    b.  The fix should be small and localized, consistent with Level 1.
3.  **Test & Verify:**
    a.  Perform a simple verification. This might be:
        *   Visual inspection of the change.
        *   Running a linter on the modified file (`run_terminal_cmd`).
        *   If a very specific unit test covers the change and is easy to run, consider `run_terminal_cmd` for that single test.
    b.  State the verification method and outcome.
4.  **Milestone:** State "L1 Implementation and verification complete. Proceeding to Documentation."

### Phase 3: DOCUMENTATION (Quick & Concise)

1.  **Update `tasks.md`:**
    a.  `fetch_rules` for `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/Level1/quick-documentation.mdc`.
    b.  Follow the template provided in `quick-documentation.mdc` to update the task entry in `memory-bank/tasks.md` using `edit_file`. This includes issue, cause (if known), solution, files changed, and verification. Mark as COMPLETED with date.
2.  **Update `activeContext.md`:**
    a.  Use `edit_file` to clear the "Focus" section in `memory-bank/activeContext.md` or set it to "Awaiting next task."
    b.  Optionally, add a one-line summary to a "Recent L1 Fixes" log in `activeContext.md`.
3.  **Notify Stakeholders (Conceptual):**
    a.  For L1, direct notification is usually not needed unless specified. The `tasks.md` update serves as the record.
4.  **Milestone:** State "L1 Documentation complete. Task [Task Name] is fully resolved."

## üö® TASK ESCALATION
*   If during IMPLEMENTATION, the issue is found to be more complex than L1 (e.g., requires changes to multiple components, design decisions, or significant testing):
    a.  State: "ESCALATION: Issue [Task Name] is more complex than initially assessed. It appears to be Level [2/3]. Recommend halting L1 workflow and re-evaluating in VAN or PLAN mode."
    b.  Use `edit_file` to update `tasks.md` and `activeContext.md` with this assessment.
    c.  Await user guidance.

This workflow prioritizes speed and efficiency for simple fixes.

# PHASED IMPLEMENTATION FOR LEVEL 4 TASKS (AI Instructions)

> **TL;DR:** This rule guides the structured, phased implementation of a Level 4 (Complex System) task. It involves breaking down the implementation into logical phases, each with its own objectives, tasks, and verification. Use `edit_file` for code and documentation, `run_terminal_cmd` for builds/tests.

This rule is typically fetched by the IMPLEMENT mode orchestrator if the task is L4.

## ‚öôÔ∏è AI ACTIONS FOR LEVEL 4 PHASED IMPLEMENTATION:

1.  **Acknowledge & Preparation:**
    a.  State: "Initiating Phased Implementation for Level 4 system: [System Name from activeContext.md]."
    b.  `read_file memory-bank/tasks.md` for the architectural plan, component breakdown, and any pre-defined implementation phases.
    c.  `read_file` all relevant `memory-bank/architecture/` and `memory-bank/creative/` documents.
    d.  `read_file memory-bank/style-guide.md` and `memory-bank/techContext.md`.
    e.  `fetch_rules` for `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/Core/command-execution.mdc` for tool usage guidelines.
2.  **Define/Confirm Implementation Phases (if not already detailed in `tasks.md`):**
    a.  Based on the architectural plan, propose or confirm a phased approach (e.g., Foundation, Core Services, Feature Extensions, Integration, Finalization).
    b.  For each phase, define:
        *   Primary objectives.
        *   Key components/modules to be built/integrated.
        *   High-level sub-tasks within that phase.
        *   Exit criteria / verification for the phase.
    c.  Use `edit_file` to document these phases and their sub-tasks within the L4 task entry in `memory-bank/tasks.md`.
3.  **Iterate Through Implementation Phases:**
    a.  For each defined phase (e.g., "Foundation Phase"):
        i.  State: "Starting [Phase Name] for system [System Name]."
        ii. `edit_file memory-bank/activeContext.md` to set focus: "Current Focus: L4 Implementation - [System Name] - [Phase Name]."
        iii. **Implement Sub-tasks for the Current Phase (from `tasks.md`):**
            *   For each sub-task in the current phase:
                *   Perform coding using `edit_file`, adhering to architectural designs, creative specs, and style guide.
                *   Write unit tests using `edit_file`.
                *   Run tests using `run_terminal_cmd`.
                *   Log actions, code changes, test results in `memory-bank/progress.md` using `edit_file`.
                *   Mark sub-task complete in `memory-bank/tasks.md` using `edit_file`.
        iv. **Phase Verification:**
            *   Once all sub-tasks for the phase are complete, perform verification as per the phase's exit criteria (e.g., specific integration tests, review of foundational components).
            *   Log verification results in `memory-bank/progress.md`.
        v.  If phase verification fails, identify issues, create new sub-tasks in `tasks.md` to address them, and re-iterate implementation/verification for those parts.
        vi. State: "[Phase Name] complete and verified for system [System Name]."
        vii. `edit_file memory-bank/tasks.md` to mark the phase as complete.
4.  **System-Wide Integration & Testing (Typically after Core/Extension phases):**
    a.  Perform broader integration tests across major components.
    b.  Conduct end-to-end system testing against key user scenarios and NFRs.
    c.  Log results in `memory-bank/progress.md`.
5.  **Finalization Phase (Last Phase):**
    a.  Performance tuning, final security reviews, documentation cleanup.
    b.  User Acceptance Testing (UAT) coordination (AI supports by providing info, user executes UAT).
    c.  Preparation for deployment (e.g., final build scripts, deployment notes).
6.  **Final Memory Bank Updates & Completion:**
    a.  Ensure `tasks.md` L4 implementation is marked complete.
    b.  Ensure `progress.md` has a comprehensive log.
    c.  Use `edit_file` to update `memory-bank/activeContext.md`: "Level 4 Phased Implementation for [System Name] complete. Ready for REFLECT mode."
    d.  State: "Level 4 system [System Name] phased implementation complete. All phases and tests passed. Recommend REFLECT mode."

## üß≠ MODE-SPECIFIC VISUAL MAPS (For AI's Conceptual Understanding)
The CMB system uses distinct orchestrator rules for each mode. You will be directed to `fetch_rules` for these as needed:
-   VAN Mode: `visual-maps/van_mode_split/van-mode-map.mdc` (Initial Analysis & Complexity)
-   PLAN Mode: `visual-maps/plan-mode-map.mdc` (Task Planning)
-   CREATIVE Mode: `visual-maps/creative-mode-map.mdc` (Design Decisions)
-   IMPLEMENT Mode: `visual-maps/implement-mode-map.mdc` (Code Implementation)
-   REFLECT Mode: `visual-maps/reflect-mode-map.mdc` (Task Review)
-   ARCHIVE Mode: `visual-maps/archive-mode-map.mdc` (Documentation & Closure)

# OPTIMIZED MEMORY BANK SYSTEM (Design Principles - AI Understanding)

> **TL;DR:** This document explains the design principles behind the Memory Bank's optimizations. You, the AI, enact these optimizations by following the specific instructions in other `.mdc` rules that guide hierarchical rule loading, adaptive complexity, progressive documentation, and efficient Memory Bank updates.

## üö® CRITICAL PREMISE: MEMORY BANK EXISTENCE
*   The entire CMB system, optimized or not, relies on the `memory-bank/` directory and its core files being present. This is typically ensured by the `main.mdc` rule fetching `Core/file-verification.mdc` at startup.

## üß≠ OPTIMIZED MODE ARCHITECTURE (Conceptual Overview)
The system uses:
*   **Context Manager (Conceptual):** Achieved by your diligent use of `read_file` for relevant context from `activeContext.md`, `tasks.md`, etc., and `edit_file` to update them.
*   **Rule Loader (Conceptual):** This is the `fetch_rules` tool, which you use as instructed by prompts or other `.mdc` files.
*   **File Manager (Conceptual):** This is primarily the `edit_file` tool for content, and `run_terminal_cmd` for directory operations.
*   **Mode Transition (Conceptual):** Managed by updating `activeContext.md` before switching modes, as guided by `Core/mode-transition-optimization.mdc` principles.

## üìà ADAPTIVE COMPLEXITY MODEL (How You Implement This)
*   You determine task complexity (Level 1-4) by following `Core/complexity-decision-tree.mdc` (usually fetched in VAN mode).
*   Based on the determined level, the workflow orchestrators (e.g., `LevelX/workflow-levelX.mdc` or main mode maps) will guide you through a process tailored to that complexity, fetching appropriate level-specific rules.
    *   L1: Streamlined (e.g., VAN ‚Üí IMPLEMENT ‚Üí Minimal REFLECT/ARCHIVE).
    *   L2: Balanced (e.g., VAN ‚Üí PLAN ‚Üí IMPLEMENT ‚Üí REFLECT).
    *   L3: Comprehensive (e.g., VAN ‚Üí PLAN ‚Üí CREATIVE ‚Üí IMPLEMENT ‚Üí REFLECT).
    *   L4: Full Governance (e.g., VAN ‚Üí PLAN (Arch) ‚Üí CREATIVE ‚Üí Phased IMPLEMENT ‚Üí REFLECT ‚Üí ARCHIVE).

## üß† HIERARCHICAL RULE LOADING (How You Implement This)
*   You achieve this by starting with a high-level orchestrator rule (e.g., `visual-maps/van_mode_split/van-mode-map.mdc`) fetched via your main custom prompt.
*   This orchestrator then instructs you to `fetch_rules` for more specific sub-rules (from `Core/`, `LevelX/`, `Phases/`, or other `visual-maps/`) only when they are needed for the current step or context.
*   This keeps your active instruction set focused and token-efficient.

## üîÑ TOKEN-OPTIMIZED CREATIVE PHASE (How You Implement This)
*   When in CREATIVE mode, and guided by rules like `Phases/CreativePhase/creative-phase-architecture.mdc` or `Phases/CreativePhase/creative-phase-uiux.mdc`, you will be instructed to use the structure from `Phases/CreativePhase/optimized-creative-template.mdc`.
*   This template encourages progressive documentation: define the problem, list options briefly, then provide detailed analysis *for selected options* or as requested, rather than exhaustively for all.

## üîÄ OPTIMIZED MODE TRANSITIONS (How You Implement This)
*   Before transitioning from one mode to another, the current mode's orchestrator will instruct you to use `edit_file` to update `memory-bank/activeContext.md` with a summary of outputs and focus for the next mode.
*   The next mode's orchestrator will then instruct you to `read_file memory-bank/activeContext.md` to pick up this context. (See `Core/mode-transition-optimization.mdc`).

## üìä MEMORY BANK EFFICIENT UPDATES (How You Implement This)
*   When using `edit_file` to update Memory Bank files (`tasks.md`, `activeContext.md`, etc.):
    *   Be precise. Modify only the relevant sections.
    *   If appending, add to the correct section.
    *   This avoids rewriting entire large files for small changes.

## üíª COMPLEXITY-BASED DOCUMENTATION (How You Implement This)
*   The `LevelX/*.mdc` rules for planning, reflection, and archiving will guide the *depth* of documentation required.
    *   Level 1: Minimal documentation, often consolidated.
    *   Level 4: Extensive, comprehensive documentation.
*   Follow the specific documentation structure and content requirements outlined in the active Level-specific rule.

## üí° USAGE GUIDANCE (Summary for AI)
1.  The CMB workflow typically starts with VAN mode, triggered by `main.mdc`.
2.  Follow the instructions from the currently fetched `.mdc` rule.
3.  Use `fetch_rules` only when explicitly instructed, to load more specific rules.
4.  Use `edit_file` for all content creation/modification in Memory Bank files.
5.  Adhere to the principles of platform awareness and command execution from Core rules.
By following these specific, contextual instructions, you inherently enact the system's optimizations.

# CREATIVE PHASE: UI/UX DESIGN GUIDELINES (AI Instructions)

> **TL;DR:** This rule guides you through designing and documenting UI/UX solutions. CRITICAL: Check for and adhere to `memory-bank/style-guide.md`. If missing, prompt user to create/link it. Document decisions in `memory-bank/creative/creative-uiux-[component_name]-[date].md` using `edit_file` and the `optimized-creative-template.mdc` structure.

This rule is typically fetched by `visual-maps/creative-mode-map.mdc` when a UI/UX design task is active.

## ‚öôÔ∏è AI ACTIONS FOR UI/UX DESIGN:

1.  **Acknowledge & Context:**
    a.  State: "Initiating CREATIVE phase for UI/UX Design: [Component/Feature from tasks.md]."
    b.  `read_file memory-bank/tasks.md` for specific UI/UX requirements, user stories, and scope.
    c.  `read_file memory-bank/activeContext.md` for overall project context.
    d.  `read_file .cursor/rules/isolation_rules/Phases/CreativePhase/optimized-creative-template.mdc` to understand the documentation structure.
2.  **Style Guide Integration (CRITICAL):**
    a.  **Check Primary Location:** `read_file memory-bank/style-guide.md`.
    b.  **If Found:** State "Style guide `memory-bank/style-guide.md` loaded. All UI/UX proposals will adhere to it." Proceed to step 3.
    c.  **If NOT Found at Primary Location:**
        i.  Prompt User: "Style guide `memory-bank/style-guide.md` not found. Is there an existing style guide at a different path or URL? If so, please provide it. Otherwise, I can help create a basic one now, or we can proceed without (not recommended for new UI)." Await user response.
        ii. **If User Provides Path/URL:** Attempt to `read_file [user_provided_path]` or conceptually access URL. If successful, state "Style guide loaded from [source]. All UI/UX proposals will adhere to it." Proceed to step 3. If fails, revert to "Style guide not available."
        iii. **If User Opts to Create:**
            1.  State: "Okay, let's define a basic style guide in `memory-bank/style-guide.md`. Please provide preferences for: Core Color Palette (primary, secondary, accent, neutrals, status colors - hex codes if possible), Typography (font families, sizes, weights for headings/body), Spacing System (base unit, Tailwind scale usage if known), Key Component Styles (buttons, inputs - general look/feel or Tailwind examples)."
            2.  Based on user input (or analysis of provided examples like screenshots if user offers them), generate content for `memory-bank/style-guide.md`. (Example structure: Headings for Colors, Typography, Spacing, Components; list defined styles under each).
            3.  Use `edit_file` to create and save this content to `memory-bank/style-guide.md`.
            4.  State: "Basic style guide created at `memory-bank/style-guide.md`. All UI/UX proposals will adhere to it." Proceed to step 3.
        iv. **If User Opts to Proceed Without:** State: "Proceeding with UI/UX design without a style guide. WARNING: This may lead to inconsistencies. I will aim for internal consistency within this component." Proceed to step 3.
3.  **Define Problem & UI/UX Requirements (Section 1 of `optimized-creative-template.mdc`):**
    a.  Clearly state the UI/UX problem (e.g., "Design an intuitive interface for user registration").
    b.  List key user stories/goals for this UI (e.g., "As a new user, I want to register quickly with minimal fields").
    c.  List functional requirements for the UI (e.g., "Must include fields for email, password, confirm password").
    d.  List relevant NFRs (e.g., "Must be responsive," "Adhere to WCAG AA accessibility").
    e.  Note any constraints (e.g., "Must use existing React component library X if possible").
4.  **Explore UI/UX Options (Section 2 & 3 of `optimized-creative-template.mdc`):**
    a.  Propose 2-3 distinct UI/UX solutions. For each, describe:
        *   Layout and structure (Information Architecture).
        *   Key interaction patterns (User Flows).
        *   Visual design approach (referencing `style-guide.md` elements like colors, fonts, spacing, component styles. If no style guide, describe choices made for consistency).
        *   How it addresses user needs and requirements.
    b.  Analyze options considering usability, A11y, feasibility (React/Tailwind), aesthetics, and **strict adherence to `style-guide.md` if available.**
5.  **Make Decision & Justify (Section 4 of `optimized-creative-template.mdc`):**
    a.  Select the most suitable UI/UX solution.
    b.  Provide clear rationale, referencing the style guide and how the chosen design meets user needs and requirements effectively.
6.  **Outline Implementation Guidelines (Section 5 of `optimized-creative-template.mdc`):**
    a.  Describe key React components to be built/used.
    b.  Suggest specific Tailwind CSS utility classes or custom CSS (if extending Tailwind per style guide) for styling key elements.
    c.  Note important states (hover, focus, disabled, error) and how they should appear (per style guide).
    d.  Mention responsive design considerations (breakpoints, mobile-first approach if applicable, per style guide).
7.  **Document in `creative-uiux-*.md`:**
    a.  Determine filename: `creative-uiux-[component_name_or_feature]-[date].md`.
    b.  Use `edit_file` to create/update `memory-bank/creative/[filename]` with all the above, structured per `optimized-creative-template.mdc`.
8.  **Update Core Memory Bank Files:**
    a.  Use `edit_file` to update `memory-bank/tasks.md`:
        *   Mark "CREATIVE: Design UI/UX for [component/feature]" sub-task as complete.
        *   Link to the created `creative-uiux-*.md` document.
    b.  Use `edit_file` to add a summary of the UI/UX decision to "Creative Decisions Log" in `memory-bank/activeContext.md`.
9.  **Completion:**
    a.  State: "UI/UX design for [Component/Feature] complete. Documented in `memory-bank/creative/[filename]`. Adherence to style guide `memory-bank/style-guide.md` [was maintained / was attempted due to no guide existing]."
    b.  (Control returns to `visual-maps/creative-mode-map.mdc`).
