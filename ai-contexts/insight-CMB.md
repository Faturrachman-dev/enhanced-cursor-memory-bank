### Purpose and Motivation

The Cursor Memory Bank addresses a key limitation of AI coding assistants: the **loss of context between sessions**. Traditional AI interactions in IDEs like Cursor often require users to repeatedly provide context, which is inefficient for large or complex projects. Memory Bank solves this by:

- **Persistent Memory**: Storing project details, task progress, and design decisions in structured files (e.g., `tasks.md`, `activeContext.md`) to maintain continuity.
- **Structured Workflow**: Organizing development into distinct phases (VAN, PLAN, CREATIVE, IMPLEMENT, REFLECT, ARCHIVE) to ensure disciplined, systematic coding.
- **Token Optimization**: Reducing the computational load on AI models by loading only relevant rules and context for each phase, critical for large codebases.
- **Documentation-Driven Approach**: Generating comprehensive documentation automatically to improve code maintainability and AI understanding.

As a personal project, Memory Bank is designed for adaptability, allowing users to customize rules via Cursor AI without relying on external support. It’s particularly valuable for developers working on large codebases, as it streamlines task management, debugging, and documentation, aligning with your interest in managing complex projects efficiently.

### Core Architecture

Memory Bank extends Cursor’s custom modes beyond simple prompt configurations into a coordinated system with interconnected components:

1. **Custom Modes**:
   - The system defines six specialized modes, each tailored to a development phase:
     - **VAN (Initialization)**: Analyzes the project structure and determines complexity (Levels 1–4).
     - **PLAN (Task Planning)**: Creates detailed implementation plans and prioritizes tasks.
     - **CREATIVE (Design Decisions)**: Explores design options with structured templates, inspired by Anthropic’s Claude "Think" tool.
     - **IMPLEMENT (Code Implementation)**: Builds or modifies code systematically.
     - **REFLECT (Review)**: Evaluates progress and documents lessons learned.
     - **ARCHIVE (Documentation)**: Produces comprehensive project documentation.
   - Each mode is configured with specific tools (e.g., Codebase Search, Edit File) and instructions stored in `custom_modes/*.md` files.

2. **Hierarchical Rule Loading**:
   - Rules are stored in `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/` and loaded selectively based on the active mode and task complexity.
   - This “lazy-loading” approach minimizes token usage, ensuring efficiency when processing large codebases.

3. **Persistent Memory Files**:
   - Memory Bank maintains context through files in the `memory-bank/` directory:
     - **tasks.md**: Central task tracker, acting as the “source of truth.”
     - **activeContext.md**: Tracks the current development focus.
     - **progress.md**: Monitors implementation status.
     - **creative-*.md**: Stores design decisions from CREATIVE mode.
     - **reflect-*.md**: Captures review insights from REFLECT mode.
   - These files ensure the AI retains project context across sessions, addressing your interest in persistent AI memory for large projects.

4. **Visual Process Maps**:
   - Uses **Mermaid diagrams** to provide visual representations of workflows and mode transitions, enhancing clarity for developers and the AI.
   - Example diagram (from the GitHub README):
     ```
     graph TD
         Main["Memory Bank System"] --> Modes["Custom Modes"]
         Main --> Rules["Hierarchical Rule Loading"]
         Main --> Visual["Visual Process Maps"]
         Main --> Token["Token Optimization"]
         Modes --> VAN["VAN: Initialization"]
         Modes --> PLAN["PLAN: Task Planning"]
         Modes --> CREATIVE["CREATIVE: Design"]
         Modes --> IMPLEMENT["IMPLEMENT: Building"]
         Modes --> REFLECT["REFLECT: Review"]
         Modes --> ARCHIVE["ARCHIVE: Documentation"]
     ```

5. **Token-Optimized Design**:
   - Implements **progressive documentation** with concise templates that scale with task complexity.
   - Uses **optimized mode transitions** to preserve critical context efficiently.
   - Adapts workflows to project complexity (e.g., skipping CREATIVE for simple tasks).

6. **QA Functionality**:
   - Not a separate mode but a set of validation functions callable from any mode by typing “QA.”
   - Enables technical validation (e.g., code testing, dependency checks) at any workflow stage.
