# Wiki Entry: AI Development & Tooling Log - Project "CursorView" & "Cursor Memory Bank (CMB)"

**Log Period:** [Start Date of Full Conversation] - [Current Date: 2025-05-14 (Simulated)]
**Primary Collaborators:** User, AI Assistant
**Overall Objective:** To enhance AI agent capabilities within the Cursor IDE through the "Cursor Memory Bank" (CMB) system, debug and document the "CursorView" application, and prepare project materials for a developer portfolio.

## 1. Introduction

This log summarizes a series of development sessions focused on two main projects:

* **CursorView:** A web application for viewing and analyzing Cursor AI chat sessions. Work involved debugging a 404 error and refining its project description for portfolio use.
* **Cursor Memory Bank (CMB):** A system designed to improve AI agent autonomy and reliability within the Cursor IDE by providing structured workflows and persistent memory. The primary effort involved refining its `.mdc` rule files and AI custom prompts.

The sessions also touched upon general AI interaction principles and optimizing workflows for AI-assisted development.

## 2. CursorView: Chat Deletion Bug Resolution & Portfolio Preparation

### 2.1. Debugging 404 Error on Chat Deletion

* **Problem:** Users encountered a 404 "Not Found" error when attempting to delete chat sessions via the CursorView web UI. The error log (`error-delete-chat.txt`) indicated an issue in `ChatList.js` calling the backend API (`DELETE /api/chat/:id`).
* **Investigation (Simulated CMB VAN Mode):**
  * The AI analyzed `error-delete-chat.txt`, `STRUCTURE.md` (for CursorView), `server.py`, and `ChatList.js` (`cursor-chat-0e71f688.json` log).
  * The root cause was identified as a mismatch in how `session_id` was accessed in the `delete_chat` function in `server.py` (expected `chat['session']['composerId']`) versus how it was structured in the data provided by `extract_chats()` (available as `chat.get('session_id')`). This was similar to a previously fixed JSON export bug.
* **Solution (Simulated CMB IMPLEMENT Mode):**
  * The AI proposed and (conceptually) implemented a fix in `server.py` by changing the lookup to use `chat.get('session_id')`.
  * Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, `tasks.md`) were updated to reflect the analysis, solution plan, and implementation. Documentation for the fix (`documentation/delete_chat_fix.md`) was also created.
* **Outcome:** The bug was resolved efficiently, with the AI demonstrating rapid diagnosis and solution proposal. This instance also led to discussions on optimizing the CMB workflow for such quick fixes.

### 2.2. Portfolio Project Description Refinement

* **Goal:** Refine the description of the "CursorView" project (from `info.md`, with original context in `prd.md`) for inclusion in a developer portfolio, aiming for a more eye-catching and modern presentation.
* **Process:**
  * The AI reviewed the user's initial `info.md`.
  * Suggestions were provided for:
    * Project Title (e.g., "CursorView: AI-Powered Chat Session Explorer").
    * One-Liner Description.
    * Detailed Description (Problem, Solution, Impact) â€“ refining wording for clarity and impact.
    * User's Role (e.g., "Lead Developer & Maintainer").
    * Technologies/Skills Used (adding specifics like ES6+, Material-UI, RAG).
    * Key Features/Highlights (focusing on user benefits and uniqueness).
  * The user incorporated feedback into a final `info.md`.
* **PRD Generation for AI:**
  * Based on the finalized `info.md`, the AI generated a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for CursorView. This PRD is intended to brief an AI assistant (like itself) to help with future tasks related to the CursorView project (e.g., documentation, feature brainstorming, visual suggestions).

## 3. Cursor Memory Bank (CMB) - System Refinement

### 3.1. Goal

To enhance the Cursor Memory Bank (CMB) system for improved AI agent autonomy, reliability, and adherence to a structured workflow within the Cursor IDE. This involved making the AI follow instructions from `.mdc` rule files and standardizing its tool usage.

### 3.2. Core Strategy & Key Decisions

* **Tool Prioritization:** A standard tool usage strategy was established:
  * `fetch_rules`: Primary for loading `.mdc` rule files.
  * `edit_file`: Primary for ALL content creation/modification in Memory Bank `.md` files, project documentation, and source code.
  * `read_file`: For general context gathering.
  * `run_terminal_cmd`: Reserved for execution tasks (builds, tests, `mkdir`), with platform awareness.
  * `codebase_search`: For "grep-like" functionality.
* **Refinement Order:**
  1. Refine all `.mdc` rule files.
  2. Refine AI Custom Prompts (for Cursor's "Advanced options").
* **`.mdc` File Generation:** A Python script (`batch.py`) was developed and iteratively improved to automate the creation and updating of `.mdc` files with refined content and correct YAML frontmatter (description, globs, alwaysApply).
* **Insights Integration:** The `insights_fetch-rules.md` and `insight-CMB.md` documents provided by the user, along with `mcp-cursor.md`, helped solidify the understanding of how Cursor's `fetch_rules` tool works and the overall architecture of the CMB system.

### 3.3. `.mdc` Rule File Refinement

The process involved translating existing logic (often from Mermaid diagrams in files like `rules-core.txt`, `rules-visual-maps.txt`, `rules-levels.txt`, `rules-phases-main.txt`) into AI-actionable textual instructions within the `.mdc` files.

* **Scope:**
  * **Core Rules (`.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/Core/`):** Foundation behaviors, tool usage, platform awareness, file paths, complexity assessment. (Refined content provided in `rules-core-refined.md`).
  * **Visual Maps (`.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/visual-maps/`):** Main orchestrator rules for each CMB mode (VAN, PLAN, CREATIVE, IMPLEMENT, REFLECT, ARCHIVE, QA) and VAN sub-components (`van_mode_split/`, `van_mode_split/van-qa-checks/`, `van_mode_split/van-qa-utils/`). These now primarily `fetch_rules` for more specific logic.
  * **LevelX Rules (`.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/LevelX/`):** Complexity-specific instructions (L1-L4) for planning, implementation, reflection, archiving, etc.
  * **Phases Rules (`.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/Phases/CreativePhase/`):** Detailed guidance for specific creative design types (architecture, UI/UX) and a template for creative outputs.
  * **Main Rules (`.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/main.mdc`, `main-optimized.mdc`):** System entry points and conceptual overviews.
* **Status:** All specified `.mdc` files have had their refined content generated and integrated into the `batch.py` script.

### 3.4. AI Custom Prompts

* **Goal:** Create concise textual prompts for each CMB mode to be pasted into Cursor's "Advanced options." These prompts primarily instruct the AI to `fetch_rules` for the main orchestrating `.mdc` file for that mode.
* **Process:** Reviewed original verbose instructions from `custom_instructions.txt` and `refined-instructions.txt`.
* **Status:** Refined prompts for VAN, PLAN, CREATIVE, IMPLEMENT, and REFLECT+ARCHIVE modes have been defined.

### 3.5. Workflow Discussions & Optimizations

* **Efficient AI vs. Strict CMB Flow:** The CursorView bug-fixing session highlighted that the AI could sometimes diagnose and fix simple issues faster than the full explicit CMB mode progression.
* **VAN Mode Triage:** It was decided to refine the `van-mode-map.mdc` orchestrator to include an early "Quick Triage & Fix" step. This allows the AI to identify and handle "Level 0-1" (very simple, localized) tasks by directly fetching `Level1/optimized-workflow-level1.mdc`, while still defaulting to the full VAN analysis for more complex or uncertain cases. This maintains CMB structure while accommodating AI efficiency.
* **User Confirmation:** Clarified the importance of the user explicitly confirming AI actions (like successful testing of a fix) to ensure Memory Bank files are updated correctly and tasks are formally closed.

## 4. Overall Current Status

* The `batch.py` script is functional and contains the refined content for all Core, Visual Maps (including VAN split), LevelX, and Phases/CreativePhase `.mdc` rules.
* The AI Custom Prompts for each CMB mode have been refined to be concise and to leverage the `.mdc` rule system.
* The "CursorView" project description has been refined for portfolio use, and a PRD has been generated for it.
* A bug in the "CursorView" project related to chat deletion has been successfully diagnosed and a fix proposed/implemented.

## 5. Next Steps (Implied before summary request)

1. **CMB System Testing:**
   * User to integrate the refined AI Custom Prompts into their Cursor IDE.
   * Thoroughly test the entire refined CMB system with a sample project/task to ensure the AI:
     * Correctly follows the structured workflow defined in the `.mdc` rules.
     * Uses the prioritized tools as intended (`fetch_rules`, `edit_file`, etc.).
     * Manages Memory Bank artifacts (`tasks.md`, `activeContext.md`, etc.) reliably.
     * Correctly handles the new "quick triage" in VAN mode.
2. **Portfolio Development:**
   * User to begin development of their portfolio website, potentially using the generated PRD for CursorView and AI assistance for content/layout.
