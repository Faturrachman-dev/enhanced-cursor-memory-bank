Okay, to ensure we pick up seamlessly in a new conversation, here's a concise list of what you should include for context:

1.  **Overall Goal:**
    *   "We are refining the **Cursor Memory Bank (CMB)** system. The main goal is to make the AI agent operate more autonomously and reliably by improving its instructions (`.mdc` rule files and AI Custom Prompts) and standardizing tool usage."

2.  **Key Decisions & Strategy So Far:**
    *   "We've decided on a **tool prioritization strategy**:
        *   **`fetch_rules` (Cursor Tool):** For loading `.mdc` rule files from `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/`.
        *   **`edit_file` (Cursor Tool):** For ALL content creation/modification in `memory-bank/*.md` files, `documentation/*.md` files, and for source code changes.
        *   **`read_file` (Cursor Tool):** For general context gathering (source code, existing CMB `.md` files).
        *   **`run_terminal_cmd` (Cursor Tool):** For execution tasks (tests, builds, `mkdir`), with platform awareness.
        *   **`Codebase Search` (Cursor Tool):** For conceptual "Grep" functionality."
    *   "Our **refinement order** is: 1) Refine all `.mdc` rule files first, then 2) Refine the AI Custom Prompts (for Cursor's 'Advanced options') to primarily `fetch_rules` these refined `.mdc` orchestrators."
    *   "We are using a Python script (`batch.py`) to generate/update the `.mdc` files with refined content and correct frontmatter (especially `description:`, `globs:`, and `alwaysApply: false` for `Agent Requested` rules)."

3.  **Current Status:**
    *   "**Tool Enablement in Cursor:** I've already updated the tool settings for each custom mode in Cursor to enable 'Fetch rules' and ensure other necessary tools like 'Edit file' are active."
    *   "**`.mdc` File Refinement:**
        *   The `batch.py` script is working.
        *   We have successfully refined and generated all `.mdc` files in the `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/Core/` directory.
        *   We have also started refining some of the main orchestrator maps in `.cursor/rules/isolation_rules/visual-maps/` (e.g., `archive-mode-map.mdc`, `creative-mode-map.mdc`, `van-mode-map.mdc` via the script)."
    *   "**AI Custom Prompts:** These have **not** been refined yet; that's the step after all `.mdc` files are done."

4.  **Immediate Next Steps (What we were about to do):**
    *   "We were about to continue refining the **remaining `.mdc` rule files**, specifically those in the `visual-maps/` directory (and its subdirectories like `van_mode_split/`, `van_mode_split/van-qa-checks/`, `van_mode_split/van-qa-utils/`), followed by `LevelX/` and `Phases/CreativePhase/` rules."
    *   "The goal for these `.mdc` refinements is to ensure their textual instructions clearly guide the AI, use the prioritized tools correctly (especially `fetch_rules` for calling sub-rules and `edit_file` for CMB `.md` file updates), and have accurate frontmatter."

5.  **Key Reference Documents You've Provided (so I can "remember" them):**
    *   `rules-core.txt` (content of Core `.mdc` files, now processed by `batch.py`)
    *   `rules-visual-maps.txt` (content of visual-maps `.mdc` files, which we are currently working on processing with `batch.py`)
    *   `insights_fetch-rules.md` (your research on how `fetch_rules` works)
    *   `conclusion.md` (your initial summary of Fetch Rules/Grep before the `insights` doc)
    *   The last "Wiki Entry" summary I provided.

Providing this context at the start of the new conversation will allow me to quickly get up to speed and continue assisting you effectively with the `.mdc` file refinements.
